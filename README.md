# GamesInOne
GamesInOne is a videogame catalog that keeps all of a personâ€™s games in one place. Users can launch their games via the click of a button, even if they belong to different digital gaming platforms, all from one centralized and easy-to-use location. All that is needed is to enter the login to all their different digital platforms and enter the games desired to be cataloged (and their address on the computer). The app aims to mitigate the struggle of trying to find games on different platforms and improve ease of use for gamers so that everything is all in one place.\

## Developer Guide
### Running BackEnd & Database Tests
In order to make use of the Google Test Suite for C++ you will need to have CMake installed on your device which you can do here: https://cmake.org/. For additional information on the proccess of setting up CMAKE you may find it useful to reference the Google Test homepage which can be found here: https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html.

Once CMake is installed please start by reading the guiding comments within the backend_testing.cc file, This file can be located within the backend folder inside the main source code. The reason for reading and understand these tests is that the tests themselves rely on certain file paths to exist which may not exist on your local computer and will require some small changes to be made. Once you're done reading, cd into the backend folder. Then run the following commands to do an initial test that contains setup commands.\
`cmake -S . -B build`                                                                      
`cmake --build build`\
`cd build`\
`mkdir dbFiles`\
`New-Item -ItemType File -Path "dbFiles\ind.dat"`\
`New-Item -ItemType File -Path "dbFiles\lst.dat"`\
`ctest`

After this is completed you can just run the following commands below to continue testing in the future. Keep in mind that after every testing run you execute you will be put into the build folder so you will need to cd out of this back into the backend folder before testing again.\
`cmake -S . -B build`                                                                      
`cmake --build build`\
`cd build`\
`ctest`
