# GamesInOne
GamesInOne is a videogame catalog that keeps all of a personâ€™s games in one place. Users can launch their games via the click of a button, even if they belong to different digital gaming platforms, all from one centralized and easy-to-use location. All that is needed is to enter the login to all their different digital platforms and enter the games desired to be cataloged (and their address on the computer). The app aims to mitigate the struggle of trying to find games on different platforms and improve ease of use for gamers so that everything is all in one place.\

DISCLAIMER - This app only runs on Windows machines.
## Dowloading, Installing, and Running
### Installing Git, MSBuild and .NET
In order to build the app and run it, you will need Git, MSBuild, and the .NET framework.
#### Installing Git
You can download Git here: https://gitforwindows.org
#### Installing MSBuild
MSBuild is included when downloading Visual Studio. If you do not have Visual Studio, you can download it here: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)\
\
WHEN INSTALLING, MAKE SURE THAT THE `Desktop development With C++` BOX AND THE `.NET desktop development` BOX ARE BOTH CHECKED. (This contains MSBuild, and .NET build tools).\
\
If Visual Studio is already installed on your device, and you do not have MSBuild, you can get it by opening the Visual Studio installer, and clicking `Modify` by the 2022 community edition, and checking the `Desktop development With C++` and `.NET desktop development` boxes before clicking `Modify` again.
#### Installing .NET
You will need .NET 4.7.2 or later to run the app. To Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472 \

To download the current version of the app, simply clone the repo git repo into the desired directory. (Must be on a Windows Computer in order for the app to work). Run:\
`git clone https://github.com/asagrekin/GamesInOne.git --branch v1.0.1`
### Installing GamesInOne
To compile, clone the git repo and run the following four commands from the repo's root directory (Yes, you need the `$` too!):\
`$env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\dotnet"`\
`dotnet restore ./src/front-end/front-end-interface/GamesInOne.sln`\
`$env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\"`\
`msbuild ./src/front-end/front-end-interface/GamesInOne.sln`
### Running GamesInOne
For now, in order to run the app, run the following command from the git repo's root directory:\
`Start "Games In One App.exe"`
### Operational Use Cases
The app allows for adding, deleting, and running games via the click of a button. This can be tested using any executable on your computer, it doesn't actually have to be games (essentially, the app will recognize any executable, even if it isn't a game).
- Add a game (simply click the `Add Game` button, in the top right hand corner).
  - The Game path field must be filled out.
  - If the name field is left blank, the game will be given the name "name".
  - If the image path field is left blank, or has an invalid image path, a default image will be displayed.
- Remove a game (click the `Delete` button on the right side of the screen, for the desired app).
- Launch a game (click the `Play` button on the right side of the screen, for the desired app).
### Running BackEnd & Database Tests
In order to make use of the Google Test Suite for C++ you will need to have CMake installed on your device which you can do here: https://cmake.org/. For additional information on the proccess of setting up CMAKE you may find it useful to reference the Google Test homepage which can be found here: https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html.

Once CMAKE is installed please start by reading the guiding comments within the backend_testing.cc file, This file can be located within the backend folder inside the main source code. The reason for reading and understand these tests is that the tests themselves rely on certain file paths to exist which may not exist on your local computer and will require some small changes to be made. Once you're done reading, cd into the backend folder. Then run the following commands to do an initial test that contains setup commands.\
`cmake -S . -B build`                                                                      
`cmake --build build`\
`cd build`\
`mkdir dbFiles`\
`New-Item -ItemType File -Path "dbFiles\ind.dat"`\
`New-Item -ItemType File -Path "dbFiles\lst.dat"`\
`ctest`

After this is completed you can just run the following commands below to continue testing in the future. Keep in mind that after every testing run you execute you will be put into the build folder so you will need to cd out of this back into the backend folder before testing again.\
`cmake -S . -B build`                                                                      
`cmake --build build`\
`cd build`\
`ctest`
