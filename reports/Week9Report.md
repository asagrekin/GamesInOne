## Contributions
### Leo & Kelby
Last week's goal:
- Make changes based on Beta Release feedback.

Progress:
- Added image files to the testing directory so they can be tested. 
- Removed having to wait for an app to close to test the launching functionality.
- We have the unit testing for all backend and database elements up to date.

Issue:
- An issue we were experiencing is figuring out how to close an already-opened app to let our tests run. Since this was usually done manually it would keep the CI running forever. We ended up just removing having to wait for the file to get manually closed. 

Goal for next week:
- Make changes based on Peer Review feedback.
