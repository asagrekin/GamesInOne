## Contributions
### Leo & Kelby
Last week's goal:
- By May 16 we plan to make changes based on Alpha Release feedback. We also plan to have handle the ability to order a list of games based on the users preference.

Progress:
- We now have new unit testing for all backend and database elements that are up to date with the Beta release. 
- We removed unnecessary files in the backend folder and enhanced the code quality of existing files.
- Added testing instructions to the top-level READ.ME so that others may test the functionality of the backend and database.
- Enhanced the CI .YAML file to cover be capable of running new tests.

Issue:
- A re-occuring issue we had was getting the Google Tests to recgonzie some of the files within our source code. We eventually learned that we needed to pre-build some of the database files by running additional terminal commands. We then added these to our CI .YAML file to enhance the tests our commits run through.  

Goal for next week:
- By May 23 we plan to make changes based on Beta Release feedback.
