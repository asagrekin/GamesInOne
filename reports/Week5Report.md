## Team Report
### Backend:
Last Week's Goal: Begin to have a functioning interaction with the database. Storing, deleting, and retrieving games that are within the database.

Progress: 

High Level Goal: Functioning interaction with the front end. Displaying, filtering, and sorting games based on user inputs.

### Frontend:
Last Week's Goal: work on handling user interactions for the front end. Look into how to communicate between C++ and C# code. Complete by April 19.

Progress: Created an add game screen to the UI, it is displayed when the user click on the "Add game" button.

High Level Goal: Application is able to create a new game row based on what has been entered by the user in the add game screen.

### Database:
Last Week's Goal: Initial database is working (can store platforms as objects in the database, and has a list of game and platform names).

Progress: Got databse working as a proof of concept. Issue is: I don't know what the backend and front end need stored in the databse, so I'm blocked on that, until I get more information.

High Level Goal: Get database working in context of app (i.e. meet requirements for what is stored based on back-end/front-end needs).

### Agenda for Project Meeting:
- Discuss current progress
