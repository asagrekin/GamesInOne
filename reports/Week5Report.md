## Team Report
### Backend:
Last Week's Goal: Begin to have a functioning interaction with the database. Storing, deleting, and retrieving games that are within the database.

Progress: We now have a functioning interaction with the database. Storing, deleting, and retrieving games that are within the database.

High Level Goal: Functioning interaction with the front end. Displaying, filtering, and sorting games based on user inputs.

### Frontend:
Last Week's Goal: work on handling user interactions for the front end. Look into how to communicate between C++ and C# code. Complete by April 19.

Progress: Created an add game screen to the UI, it is displayed when the user click on the "Add game" button.

High Level Goal: Application is able to create a new game row based on what has been entered by the user in the add game screen.

### Database:
Last Week's Goal: Get database working in context of app (i.e. meet requirements for what is stored based on back-end/front-end needs).

Progress: Got the database fully up and running, and merged it to main. Synced with the back-end to make sure everything was working properly, and they were able to use it.

High Level Goal: Finalize the database (deals with errors in saving robustly, stores data efficiently, etc). Also, any additional features needed for the front end get added.

### Agenda for Project Meeting:
